# Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for multi-class image classification. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the notebook is designed to classify images into 10 distinct categories. The model is implemented with TensorFlow and Keras for efficient training, evaluation, and testing.
