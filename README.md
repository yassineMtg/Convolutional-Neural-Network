# Convolutional-Neural-Network

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. I designed and evaluated various CNN architectures and layer configurations, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras for implementation. The CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes, served as the basis for training and validation, with an 80-20 split between the two. The aim was to achieve robust classification performance while experimenting with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

## Methodology

I structured the CNN with a series of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Initially, the architecture consisted of convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. The model concluded with a dense layer of 10 neurons for multi-class classification. Additionally, I experimented with ResNet50, a pre-trained deep architecture, adapting it for CIFAR-10 to compare its performance with the custom CNN.

Training employed the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function. I utilized callbacks such as ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping, and ModelCheckpoint to dynamically adjust learning rates, prevent overfitting, and save the best-performing model configurations. Hyperparameter tuning, including adjustments to batch size and learning rate, was critical in improving the model’s generalization capabilities.

## Results

The training and validation performance was assessed through accuracy and loss metrics. Key highlights include:

The use of ReduceLROnPlateau to address learning plateaus.
Insights from confusion matrices, which revealed the model’s strengths and areas needing improvement.
Benchmarking against ResNet50, which demonstrated the trade-offs between custom CNNs and pre-trained deeper architectures.
The model achieved a balance between high accuracy and low loss, showcasing strong classification performance on both training and validation sets.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was balancing model complexity with overfitting, particularly when using deeper architectures like ResNet50. Selecting optimal hyperparameters required extensive experimentation, and tools like confusion matrices and learning rate schedules were invaluable in diagnosing and addressing performance issues. This iterative process underscored the importance of visualization tools in guiding model development.

## Future Work

There are several opportunities to extend this project, including:

Exploring Vision Transformers (ViTs) for global context understanding.
Applying advanced data augmentation techniques like mixup and random erasing to improve model generalization.

## Conclusion

Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, this project demonstrated the efficacy of CNNs in image classification tasks. The use of adaptive learning rate strategies and pre-trained architectures highlighted the potential for further advancements in this field. The insights gained serve as a foundation for future explorations into deep learning and computer vision.
